# Park-it App
This is a application that allows users to reserve parking spots.

## Instructions to Run
After cloning the repo,
            
            cd park-it-app

Ensure all dependencies are installed,

            npm install

Then run,

            expo start

in the terminal you should see an address ex: http://localhost:19002, visit this url on your browser


Before continuing ensure an Android Emulator is running. Once that is up and running, click on "Run on Android device/emulator". You will see a loading bar in the terminal and once that is finished the app will be running on the emulator
